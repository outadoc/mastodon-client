# woolly-app
This project is a Mastodon client built with Jetpack Compose and Compose Desktop. That means it can run on both Android devices (smartphones, tablets) and desktop (macos, Windows, Linux—anything that can run a JVM).

## Sibling projects
- [mastodonk](https://github.com/outadoc/mastodonk) — A Kotlin/Multiplatform API client for Mastodon, built with Ktor.
